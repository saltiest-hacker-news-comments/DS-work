    "According to Urban Dictionary, a salty person is someone that’s bitter (kinda weird since bitter and salty are completely different tastes, but the transformation of the English language is a topic for another day). Can we predict which users of Hacker News are the saltiest/most toxic based on the comments they post? Can we help users identify whose comments on Hacker News to ignore in order to make their time on the site more enjoyable? How will we determine what “salty” means?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this sentiment analysis model, we will use Vader Sentiment due to its simplicity and ability to handle text typically found on social media (robust measures regarding slang, capitalized letters, emojis, and punctuation). In order to determine a user's \"saltiness\", we will utilize 3 of Vader's polarity scores: positivity, compound, and negative. Positive and negative scores are self-explanatory; however, the compound score is worth understanding further. According to the Vader Sentiment documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Furthermore, the documentation breaks down how sentiment is obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Typical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "        positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05\n",
    "        neutral sentiment: (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)\n",
    "        negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "        The pos, neu, and neg scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation). These are the most useful metrics if you want multidimensional measures of sentiment for a given sentence.\n",
    "        \n",
    "With this understanding, we can now derive a formula to determine the saltiness of our users' comments. For our purposes, we want to give a bit more weight to the positive and negative ratios, so we will define our score formula as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Saltiness Score** = *Positive Ratio* + *Compound Score* - *Negative Ratio*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We only need to perform sentiment analysis on the users' comments, so we'll only focus on the 'text' column. The goal here is to perform an analysis on each comment, and append the comment's score to a corresponding 'score' column."
